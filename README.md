# PRISM - Phishing Reporting and Incident Security Mitigation 
*This project is currently under development.*

These streamlined modules are designed to efficiently mitigate phishing threats across *multiple* Google Workspaces by automaticlly. The system loads and processes data from Google Email Log Search exports, enabling quick detection, analysis, and resolution.

## Example
```python

google_client = Google()
reporter = Reporter()

log_data = load_email_log_search_export('gmail_log.csv')
reporter.generate_report("report.pdf", log_data)

for user in log_data:
    # Attempt to delete the email
    if not google_client.delete_email(user.message_id, user.email):
        print(f"[-] Failed to delete email with ID {user.message_id} in {user.email}'s inbox.")
    
    # Check if the user opened the email and suspend if necessary
    if user.opened_email:
        if not google_client.suspend(user.email):
            print(f"[-] Failed to suspend user: {user.email}")
```
